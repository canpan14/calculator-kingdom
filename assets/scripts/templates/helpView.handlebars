      <h4 id="item-1">How to Play</h4>
      <p>This section will cover the elements that go into playing the game.</p>
      <h5 id="item-1-1">The Hand</h5>
      <p>Your hand (on the bottom left of the page) consists of troops randomly picks from the types of troops in your army.</p>
      <p>Every round your goal is to play as many of those troops as possible to the field.</p>
      <h5 id="item-1-2">The Calculator</h5>
      <p>The calculator (on the bottom right of the page) consists of the numbers that will be using to pay the costs to play the troops in your hand.</p>
      <p>Using the numbers and the +/-/x operators, create the numbers to match the costs on the troops cards.</p>
      <p>The calculator can be cleared back to it's previous state by pressing the C button, until a card is played. Every round the calculator will be reset to a random state.</p>
      <h5 id="item-1-3">The Playing Field</h5>
      <p>The playing field (the top half of the page) is where the cards that you and the enemy play will be displayed. Cards that you play will be displayed on the top left, and cards the enemy play will be on the top right. The respective health of each combatant is also in these areas.</p>
      <h5 id="item-1-4">Fighting a Round</h5>
      <p>Every round your attack cards fight their defense cards and vice versa.</p>
      <p>If your attack cards combined power exceeds their defence cards armor, they take damage equal to the amount over.</p>
      <p>If your power is below their armor, their defense will fight back, dealing damage equal to their combined power minus your attackers armor.</p>
      <p>The same occurs for the enemy attacking your defense</p>
      <p>A winner is decided when a participants health reaches 0. If both people die at the same time, the enemy is the victor. Kingdoms can't survive without their king.</p>
      <h4 id="item-2">How to Make Armies</h4>
      <p>While you can quick play using random troops, it is best to assemble and army that works well together and has a proper balance.</p>
      <p>To craft an army, head to the Barracks from the Keep and create a new Army.</p>
      <p>View and add the cards you want to your army using the menu, name the army, and then save it.</p>
      <p>Afterwards return to the Keep, choose the option to defend your kingdom, then your army to begin playing with that deck.</p>
      <p>Be aware that armies with less than the required amount of types (4) will be backfilled with random troop types.</p>
      <h4 id="item-3">How to Change Password</h4>
      <p>To change your password, click on the Change the Locks option in the navigation menu at the top of the screen at any time.</p>
      <h4 id="item-4">How to Sign Out</h4>
      <p>To sign out, click on the Abandon your Kingdom option option in the navigation menu at the top of the screen at any time. Return soon! Your Kingdom requires your leadership to survive.</p>
